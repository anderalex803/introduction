# Introduction
This page explains about 'ezygeo-ai' that was found by [mheriyanto](https://github.com/mheriyanto), [hpratama](https://github.com/hpratama), [LorisAlif](https://github.com/LorisAlif), [ylumbangaol](https://github.com/ylumbangaol), and [albaanyf](https://github.com/albaanyf). We met first in [Department of Geophysical Engineering, University of Pertamina](https://geoph.universitaspertamina.ac.id/), and often discuss about [Python Programming and Geophysics](https://sites.google.com/site/metkomup/), especially in [Python Courses](https://sites.google.com/site/metkomup/seg-sc-up) and [Python for Geoscientists Course](http://segscup.org/pycourse/) that held by Society of Exploration Geophysicists Student Chapter, University of Pertamina ([SEG SC UP](segscup.org)).

We think this image below, that can explain why we choose **ezygeo-ai** for our community. Because "**AI** or **Artificial Intelligence** is the main head of all the other technologies and at the same time, all technologies are co-related to each other. **Machine Learning (ML)**, Deep Learning (DL), and Neural Network (NN) all are the sub-parts of AI." - [intellipaat.com](https://intellipaat.com/community/9868/what-is-the-difference-between-deep-learning-and-traditional-artificial-neural-network-machine-learning)

"Data science is the extraction of relevant insights from data. It uses various techniques from many fields like mathematics, **machine learning**, computer programming, statistical modeling, data engineering and visualization, **pattern recognition and learning**, uncertainty modeling, data warehousing, and cloud computing." - [Aravind Venugopal, School of AI](https://medium.com/school-of-ai-trivandrum/how-to-become-an-ai-engineer-8f6416ef5ca4)
