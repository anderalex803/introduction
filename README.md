# Introduction
This page explains about 'ezygeo-ai' that built by [mheriyanto](https://github.com/mheriyanto), [hpratama](https://github.com/hpratama), loris, yosua, and alba. We met first in [Department of Geophysical Engineering, University of Pertamina](https://geoph.universitaspertamina.ac.id/), and often discuss about [Python Programming and Geophysics](https://sites.google.com/site/metkomup/), especially in [Python Courses](https://sites.google.com/site/metkomup/seg-sc-up) and [Python for Geoscientists Course](http://segscup.org/pycourse/) that held by Society of Exploration Geophysicists Student Chapter University of Pertamina ([SEG SC UP](segscup.org)).
